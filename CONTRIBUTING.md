# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing to Matcha!

## Where to Contribute

We cultivate [a set of issues][open-issues-good-first-issue] that are good ways to contribute to Matcha for the first time.

Looking for other ways to contribute? Consider:

- **_[Improving the documentation][open-issues-kind-documentation]_**

  Documentation is the most valuable contribution you can make directly to the repository!

  It is easy to overlook documentation when programming, and difficult to look back on something you understand and see where others may get confused.

  This makes it hard to keep documentation high-quality, and all assistance in fighting entropy is invaluable!

- **_[Tackling something that doesn't require extensive knowledge of the codebase][open-issues-level-simple]_**

  These are less-involved issues that should be approachable without spending a bunch of time studying the entire project.

  They generally touch parts of the library that are similar across other Elixir and open-source projects.

- **_[Addressing regressions in upcoming releases to the language][open-upcoming-regressions]_**

  Matcha continuously looks ahead to upcoming language releases, running its test suite against them to anticipate compatibility issues.

  If a storm is brewing on the horizon, the bleeding-edge test suite normally catches it, with more than enough time for someone to jump in and deal with the regression.

- **_[Submitting a PR][open-a-pr]_**

  See a typo or a broken link? Is existing documentation unclear, or does following it lead to behaviour you consider surprising? Jump in and help us correct it!

- **_[Starting a discussion][open-a-new-discussion]_**

  Have an idea for an improvement or an enhancement, but don't see a issue for it yet? Crack open a discussion and flesh it out with the maintainers!

- **_[Opening a new issue][open-a-new-issue]_**

  Is something else the matter, or do the ideas above not fit what you have in mind? Create an issue and continue the conversation!

## Code

Want to contribute code? Here's what you need to know.

### Reserved Branches & Tags

- [`latest`][branch-latest] is the integration branch where work comes together.

  This means that you can get the "cutting edge" version of Matcha via:

  ```elixir
  Mix.install matcha: [github: "christhekeele/matcha", ref: "latest"]
  ```

- [`release`][branch-release] is the staging branch where code intended for the next release is placed.

  This means that you can get the "release candidate" version of Matcha via:

  ```elixir
  Mix.install matcha: [github: "christhekeele/matcha", ref: "release"]
  ```

- [`stable`][tag-stable] is the floating pointer to the "highest" semantic version of Matcha released to [hex.pm][hex-matcha].

  This means that the "latest official" version of Matcha is available identically via:

  ```elixir
  Mix.install matcha: [github: "christhekeele/matcha", ref: "stable"]
  ```

  and

  ```elixir
  Mix.install matcha: ">= 0.0.0"
  ```

- [tags starting with `v`][hex-versions], ex `vX.Y.Z-mayberc`, represent versions published to [hex.pm][hex-matcha].

  If versions must be modified or yanked, currently these tags must be deleted or moved manually.

  This means that these two are equivalent:

  ```elixir
  Mix.install matcha: [github: "christhekeele/matcha", ref: "vX.Y.Z-mayberc"]
  ```

  and

  ```elixir
  Mix.install matcha: "vX.Y.Z-mayberc"
  ```

All other branch or tag names are fair game.

### Project Structure

Matcha is a pretty standard Elixir library, and should be navigable to anyone familiar with such things. Here is the map, with points of interest where it may deviate from a typical project:

## Guides

Guides are maintained in the [docs/guides][guides] folder and built with [livebook][livebook].

I recommend developing them against an [actual local instance][livebook-locally-escript] of livebook, via `LIVEBOOK_TOKEN_ENABLED=false livebook server --root-path docs/guides`.
Avoid having the `.livemd` files also open in an editor as you work on a guide, to avoid getting into save-tug-of-war.

## Tests

### Checks

Matcha has three different checks that may run during various automatic builds. If you want to get ahead of build failures, you can run them all locally before pushing up code with the command `mix checks`.
(This is the default task, so you can simply invoke it via `mix`.)
This is equivalent to running:

- `mix test`

  Runs the tests found in `test/`, checking for failures.

- `mix lint`

  Checks for compiler warnings, formatting divergences, and [style problems][credo].

- `mix typecheck`

  Runs [dialyzer][dialyzer], checking for provable type issues.

### Suites

Matcha has 5 test suites that run different checks automatically, depending on what's happening, for different versions of erlang/OTP, Elixir, and Matcha's dependencies.

#### Versions

The sets of versions we run checks against are named:

- `preferred`

  - `otp`: The latest minor version of the highest major version erlang we want to support

  - `elixir`: The latest patch version of highest minor Elixir we want to support

  - `deps`: The locked-down version of our dependencies in our `mix.lock`

- `matrix`

  - `otp`: The latest minor versions of every major erlang version we want to support

  - `elixir`: The latest patch versions of every minor Elixir version we want to support

  - `deps`: The locked-down version of our dependencies in our `mix.lock`

- `edge`

  - `otp`: The latest major version erlang

  - `elixir`: The upcoming version of Elixir available on its default branch

  - `deps`: The un-locked version of dependencies in our `mix.exs`

#### Workflows

The automated test workflows we run are:

- **[Test Suite][test-suite]**

  - **Runs** all `mix checks` for the `preferred` versions of our dependencies.

  - **Runs on** every set of commits pushed up to GitHub, on source or forked repositories.

  - **Provides** continuous feedback on every potential change to the codebase.

- **[Test Status][test-status]**

  - **Runs** the _Test Suite_, and updates related code quality services about its robustness.

  - **Runs on** every set of commits added to the `latest` and `release` branches.

  - **Provides** insight into test meta-data like code coverage, documentation quality, etc. displayed in the README.md.

- **[Test Matrix][test-matrix]**

  - **Runs** all `mix checks` for every set of versions in our `matrix` of dependencies.

  - **Runs on** every set of commits added to the `latest` branch.

  - **Provides** full feedback on if each approved change will work on all supported versions.

- **[Test Release][test-release]**

  - **Runs** the _Test Matrix_, and performs a dry-run of a planned release.

  - **Runs on** every set of commits added to pull requests to the `release` branch.

  - **Provides** a preview of what a release would look like if published from the `release` branch on all supported versions.

- **[Test Edge][test-edge]**

  - **Runs** all `mix checks` for the `edge` versions of our dependencies.

  - **Runs on** UTC midnight.

  - **Provides** continuous feedback on how prepared the codebase is for upstream changes in dependencies.
